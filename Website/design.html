  Following on from my investigation, it is clear from the results of my questionnaire that my artefact will need to track noise levels if the user is drinking water and if the users and taking addequete breaks to satisfy the requirements of the end users

  I plan to create an artifact that will track when the user drinks water. the noise level in there study area and the amount of time has passed. 

  <br> 
  I plan to meet the basic requirements by: 
  <ol> 
    <li> My interpration of fully automated was the system istelf was to be automated but it could recive input form the user, for example if the user had not moved in a while a sound would play on the microbit until a button was pressed while when another button was pressed it actually started tracking </li>

    <li> I will use python code to take in data check its validity and store it in a csv file</li>
    <li> I will use pyhton code to use the data and split it into its differnt types and graph the data</li>
  </ol>

  <ol>
    <li></li>
