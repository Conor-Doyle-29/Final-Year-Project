<h1><center>Investigation & Plan</center></h1>
<p>After getting the brief I studied it carefully and came up with 3 topic's <br>
  <ol>
    <li> Sleep </li>
    <li> Studying Planning </li>
    <li> Running Tracker </li>
  </ol>

<h2>Why not these topics</h2>
<p>Ultimately I decided on Study tracking and how it effects wellbeing, I decided to go with it over sleep and running as form my research on sleep I could not see a way to fully complete the project as i initially struggled to come up with ideas. <br></p>
<p>For the running tracker I felt as though I would not be able to get enough variables with the sensors I had available to me. <br>  </p> 
<h2>Chosen Topic</h2>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>I chose study tracker as i suffer from anxiety when it comes to exams and study. This leads to me not prefroming well in tests and this leads to more stress and is extremlely negative for my mental wellbeing. I also as a result suffer from frequent panic attacks and this sometimes leads me to lose weight as I feel as though I don't have time to eat. I sometimes listen to music when studying and I think this project will help me learn if this is a viable way to study</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>I did research on what kind of data I could take in in relation to study. I realized I could take in sound levels and then did research on what levels are best for it. I found that anything below 32 db lead to the best for learning<br> </p>
<p>I then did research on the temperatures that is best for studying and determined that 18-25 degrees Celsius was the best for learning and studying <br></p>
<p>I did research on how hydration effects both study and results which can lead to a better mental wellbeing as well as the physical benefits of remaining hydrated. I learned that students who remain hydrated on average preform 5% better in exams</p>
<p>I researched the effects of music on studying and how it effects learning but I decided against continuing with trying to track it after this stage due to how subjective the answer and research seemed to be</p>

<h2>Other Products</h2>
<p>Through my research I learned that there is not many applications or websites or products that preform what I plan to do with my artefact. For the timing aspect I found a chrome extension called marinara pomodoro. The closest other thing I found was a water intake tracker called Waterminder but it was not automatic and required user to enter that data</p>

<h2>Questionnaire</h2>
<br> <p>As part of the research that I preformed a questionnaire to learn more about the features and the demand for the artefact I planned to create. <br></p> 
<h3>Results</h3>

<p>From the results that many end users do not use a study tracker but would like to if it also allowed them to take breaks </p>
