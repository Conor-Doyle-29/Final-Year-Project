<h1><center>Evaluation</center></h1>
<p>Overall I am very happy that I was able to meet all the requirements both basic and advanced. I was able to take in data from the embedded system and also create a model. This allowed me to complete the other task as laid out in the brief</p>
<h3>How It met user Requirements</h3>
<p>As I learned from my questionnaire that many users did not use a study tracker but said they would if one was available. In this way i felt I met the user requirements. <br> In my initial research I had planned one of my what if questions to be how music effected studying. So some of my questions reflected that. But when it came time to try and code this I found it would be to difficult and require more time then was available</p>
<h3>With More Time</h3>
<p>With more time I would have liked to continue to try and figure out a way to at least simulate the tracking of music and how different types effect study and learning and ultimately effect the mental wellbeing of students <br></p>
<p>I also think with more time I would have liked to actually have a water level tracker to the artefact for more accurate hydration levels. But I decided against this again due to time constraints. </p>
<h3>If it was taken to market</h3>
<p>If this artefact was taken to market I would try and use a more advanced circuit such as an Arduino and try to integrate into a mobile app to easier access to a wider audience. I again would also add the music tracking feature with potential Spotify Integration </p>
